Save the data inside the project directory. This should result in the following structure (not all files are shown, general idea is given):

project
-- data
---- google_trends
---- kaggle_debates
---- spectrograms
-- dashboard.py
-- utils.py

How to run code: ensure you are "cd-ed" into our project directory, run "pip install -r requirements.txt", then run "python dashboard.py"
